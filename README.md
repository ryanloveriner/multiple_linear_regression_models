# multiple_linear_regression_models

### Overview

Multiple linear regression modeling is a statistical technique used in regression analysis when a model has more than one potential predictive variable. [This project](https://github.com/ryanloveriner/multiple_linear_regression_models/blob/main/ADA%20Simple%20Multiple%20Linear%20Regression.pdf) is a great example of how to approach multiple linear regression in R. It was written as part of an Advanced Data Analytics course at the University of New Mexico and uses a variety of tidyverse tools as well as a library provided by the course instructor, [Dr. Erik Erhardt](https://statacumen.com/about/).

First, correlations between the individual predictive variables and the response variable are examined for correlation using
