# multiple_linear_regression_models

### Overview

Multiple linear regression modeling is a statistical technique used in regression analysis when a model has more than one potential predictive variable. [This project](https://github.com/ryanloveriner/multiple_linear_regression_models/blob/main/ADA%20Simple%20Multiple%20Linear%20Regression.pdf) is a great example of how to approach multiple linear regression in R. It was written as part of an Advanced Data Analytics course at the University of New Mexico and uses a variety of tidyverse tools as well as a library provided by the course instructor, [Dr. Erik Erhardt](https://statacumen.com/about/).

### Data

The [data used in the project](https://github.com/ryanloveriner/multiple_linear_regression_models/blob/main/ADA%20Simple%20Multiple%20Linear%20Regression%20Data.csv) is a .csv file and was provided by the course instructor.

### Method

First, the individual predictive variables and the response variable are examined for correlation using a scatterplot matrix. The model fit is then assessed to ensure assumptions are met and partial regression residual plots are used to ensure linearity is supported. Finally, model coefficients are calculated and assessed. The R code for these techniques is available [here](https://github.com/ryanloveriner/multiple_linear_regression_models/blob/main/ADA%20Simple%20Multiple%20Linear%20Regression.qmd). Please note that this is a Quarto markdown file--similar to an Rmarkdown, but you'll need to have quarto installed in order to knit it.
